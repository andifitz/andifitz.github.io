My name is Andi Fitzgibbon (she/her). I am a stream ecosystem ecology PhD candidate at Kent State University (Greater Cleveland, Ohio region) where I study algal biofilms (slime on rocks and sediment), ecosystem processes (photosynthesis and respiration) and nutrient cycling. 

Over the next few weeks I'll be building this site to share some interesting bits of research and fun data analysis tricks I've picked up along the way.
